It happens a lot that you need to loop over an Array with JavaScript Objects! But sometimes you just donâ€™t know what kind of properties that Object has. Lucky we are that JavaScript offers a few ways of looping over JavaScript Object properties.

I wanted to share 3 of them with you. So hopefully this will help you in the right direction.

## The Object to loop over

First, we need an example object to loop over. So I put some of my experience in it ðŸ˜‰ (hahaha)! Keep the fun in it!

<pre>let experienceObject = {
    name: 'Raymon',
    title: 'Lead Frontend/JavaScript Developer',
    yearsExperience: 8,
    projects: [
        {
            name: 'ANWB',
            title: 'Senior JavaScript Developer',
            techniques: ['Angular', 'ES6', 'Vanilla JavaScript', 'Less', 'CSS']
        },
        {
            name: 'NATO',
            title: 'Lead JavaScript Developer',
            techniques: ['Angular 2', 'AngularJS', 'ES6', 'Vanilla JavaScript', 'Web Sockets', 'D3']
        },
        {
            name: 'Rabobank',
            title: 'Senior Frontend Developer',
            techniques: ['Vanilla JavaScript', 'CSS', 'Responsive Webdesign']
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

## Object.keys(experienceObject).map()

The first example is the Object.keys map method to loop over the properties of the Object it.

<pre>Object.keys(experienceObject).map(e =&gt; {
    console.log(`key= ${e} value = ${experienceObject[e]}`)
});
</pre>

## Object.entries(experienceObject).forEach()

The second example is the Object.keys with the forEach method over the properties of the Object it.

<pre>Object.entries(experienceObject).forEach(([key, value]) =&gt; {
    console.log(`key= ${key} value = ${value}`)
})
</pre>

## For-in loop

The last example is the For-in loop to loop over the properties of the Object it.

<pre>for (property in experienceObject) {
  console.log(`key= ${property} value = ${experienceObject[property]}`)
}
</pre>
